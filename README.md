# JInjector
Copyright Â© 2013, Jeremy Tregunna, All Rights Reserved.

JInjector is an iOS and OS X dependency injection library. It is extremely light weight, and may not suit all purposes. It is not as flexible as some other IoC libraries, but this one suits my needs quite handily, YMMV.

## Installation

How you get this library into your build setup is your business. You can use git submodules, copy files, whatever you like. Should you choose to add our project file to your workspace, you can merely depend on the resulting library or framework product, and that should be all you need.

## License

The terms under which use and distribution of this library is governed may be found in the [LICENSE](https://github.com/jeremytregunna/JInjector/blob/master/LICENSE) file.

## Contributing

If you think you can help out, with code, documentation, whatever. Let me know. Preferably, use a pull request and attach test code along with your code. Please also see [this document](https://github.com/jeremytregunna/JInjector/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on our contributors agreement.
